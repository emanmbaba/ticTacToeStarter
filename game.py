#Implementation of Two Player Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python.

''' We will make the board using dictionary 
    in which keys will be the location(i.e : top-left,mid-right,etc.)
    and initialliy it's values will be empty space and then after every move 
    we will change the value according to player's choice of move. '''

theBoard = {'7': ' ' , '8': ' ' , '9': ' ' ,
            '4': ' ' , '5': ' ' , '6': ' ' ,
            '1': ' ' , '2': ' ' , '3': ' ' }

board_keys = []

for key in theBoard:
    board_keys.append(key)

''' We will have to print the updated board after every move in the game and 
    thus we will make a function in which we'll define the printBoard function
    so that we can easily print the board everytime by calling this function. '''

def printBoard(board):
    print(board['7'] + '|' + board['8'] + '|' + board['9'])
    print('-+-+-')
    print(board['4'] + '|' + board['5'] + '|' + board['6'])
    print('-+-+-')
    print(board['1'] + '|' + board['2'] + '|' + board['3'])

# Now we'll write the main function which has all the gameplay functionality.
def game():

    turn = 'X'
    count = 0
